<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<section anchor="motivation"><name>Motivation</name>

<t>BRSKI, as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>, specifies a solution for
secure automated zero-touch bootstrapping of new devices, so-called pledges.
This includes the discovery of the registrar in the target domain,
time synchronization, and the exchange of security information
necessary to establish mutual trust between pledges and the target domain.</t>

<t>A pledge gains trust in the target domain via the domain registrar as follows.
It obtains security information about the domain,
specifically a domain certificate to be trusted,
by requesting a voucher object defined in <xref target="RFC8366"/>.
Such a voucher is a self-contained signed object
originating from a Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA).
Therefore, the voucher may be provided
in online mode (synchronously) or offline mode (asynchronously).
The pledge can authenticate the voucher
because it is shipped with a trust anchor of its manufacturer such that
it can validate signatures (including related certificates) by the MASA.</t>

<t>Trust by the target domain in a pledge is established by providing the pledge
with a domain-specific LDevID certificate.
The certification request of the pledge is signed using its IDevID secret and can be
validated by the target domain using the trust anchor of the pledge manufacturer,
which needs to pre-installed in the domain.</t>

<t>For enrolling devices with LDevID certificates,
BRSKI typically utilizes Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) <xref target="RFC7030"/>.
EST has its specific characteristics, detailed in <xref target="using-est"/>.
In particular, it requires online or on-site availability of the RA
for performing the data origin authentication and final authorization decision
on the certification request.
This type of enrollment can be called 'synchronous enrollment'.
For various reasons,
it may be preferable to use alternative enrollment protocols such as
the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) <xref target="RFC4210"/>
profiled in <xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile"/>
or Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) <xref target="RFC5272"/>.
that are more flexible and independent of the transfer mechanism because they
represent certification request messages as authenticated self-contained objects.</t>

<t>Depending on the application scenario,
the required RA/CA components may not be part of the registrar.
They even may not be available on-site but rather be
provided by remote backend systems. The registrar or its deployment site may not have
an online connection with them or the connectivity may be intermittent.
This may be due to security requirements for operating the backend systems
or due to site deployments where on-site or always-online operation
may be not feasible or too costly.
In such scenarios, the authentication and authorization of certification requests
will not or can not be performed on-site at enrollment time.
In this document, enrollment that is not performed in a (time-wise) consistent
way is called 'asynchronous enrollment'.
Asynchronous enrollment requires a store-and-forward transfer of certification
requests along with the information needed for authenticating the requester.
This allows offline processing the request.</t>

<t>Application scenarios may also involve network segmentation, which is utilized
in industrial systems to separate domains with different security needs.
Such scenarios lead to similar requirements if the TLS connection
carrying the requester authentication is terminated
and thus request messages need to be forwarded on further channels
before the registrar/RA can authorize the certification request.
In order to preserve the requester authentication, authentication information
needs to be retained and ideally bound directly to the certification request.</t>

<t>There are basically two approaches for forwarding certification requests
along with requester authentication information:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A trusted component (e.g., a local RA) in the target domain is needed
that forwards the certification request combined with the validated identity of
the requester (e,g., its IDevID certificate)
and an indication of successful verification of
the proof-of-possession (of the corresponding private key) in a way
preventing changes to the combined information.
When connectivity is available, the trusted component
forwards the certification request together with the requester information
(authentication and proof-of-possession) for further processing.
This approach offers only hop-by-hop security.
The backend PKI must rely on the local pledge authentication result
provided by the local RA
when performing the authorization of the certification request.
In BRSKI, the EST server is such a trusted component,
being co-located with the registrar in the target domain.</t>
  <t>Involved components use authenticated self-contained objects for the enrollment,
directly binding the certification request and the requester authentication
in a cryptographic way.
This approach supports end-to-end security,
without the need to trust in intermediate domain components.
Manipulation of the request and the requester identity information
can be detected during the validation of the self-contained signed object.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Focus of this document is the support of alternative enrollment protocols that allow
using authenticated self-contained objects for device credential bootstrapping.
This enhancement of BRSKI is named BRSKI-AE,
where AE stands for alternative enrollment protocols and for asynchronous enrollment.
This specification carries over the main characteristics of BRSKI,
namely that the pledge obtains trust anchor information
for authenticating the domain registrar and other target domain components
as well as a domain-specific X.509 device certificate (the LDevID certificate)
along with the corresponding private key (the LDevID secret) and certificate chain.</t>

<t>The goals are to enhance BRSKI to</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>support alternative enrollment protocols,</t>
  <t>support end-to-end security for enrollment, and</t>
  <t>make it applicable to scenarios involving asynchronous enrollment.</t>
</list></t>

<t>This is achieved by</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>extending the well-known URI approach with an additional path element
indicating the enrollment protocol being used, and</t>
  <t>defining a certificate waiting indication and handling, for the case that the
certifying component is (temporarily) not available.</t>
</list></t>

<t>This specification can be applied to both synchronous and asynchronous enrollment.</t>

<t>In contrast to BRSKI, this specification supports offering multiple enrollment protocols
on the infrastructure side, which enables pledges and their developers
to pick the preferred one.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sup-env"><name>Supported Environment</name>

<t>BRSKI-AE is intended to be used in domains that may have limited support
of on-site PKI services and comprises application scenarios like the following.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>There are requirements or implementation restrictions
that do not allow using EST for enrolling an LDevID certificate.</t>
  <t>Pledges and/or the target domain already have an established
certificate management approach different from EST that shall be reused
(e.g., in brownfield installations).</t>
  <t>There is no registration authority available on site in the target domain.
Connectivity to an off-site RA is intermittent or entirely offline.
A store-and-forward mechanism is used
for communicating with the off-site services.</t>
  <t>Authoritative actions of a local RA are limited and may not be sufficient
for authorizing certification requests by pledges.
Final authorization is done by an RA residing in the operator domain.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="list-examples"><name>List of Application Examples</name>

<t>Bootstrapping can be handled in various ways, depending on the application domains.
The informative <xref target="app-examples"/> provides illustrative examples from
various industrial control system environments and operational setups.
They motivate the support of alternative enrollment protocols,
based on the following examples of operational environments:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Rolling stock</t>
  <t>Building automation</t>
  <t>Electrical substation automation</t>
  <t>Electric vehicle charging infrastructures</t>

  </dd>
</dl>

</section>
<section anchor="req-sol"><name>Requirements and Mapping to Solutions</name>

<section anchor="basic-requirements"><name>Basic Requirements</name>

<t>There were two main drivers for the definition of BRSKI-AE:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The solution architecture may already use or require
a certificate management protocol other than EST.
Therefore, this other protocol should be usable for requesting LDevID certificates.</t>
  <t>The domain registrar may not be the (final) point that authenticates and authorizes
certification requests and the pledge may not have a direct connection to it.
Therefore, certification requests should be self-contained signed objects.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Based on the intended target environment described in <xref target="sup-env"/> and
the application examples described in <xref target="app-examples"/>, the following
requirements are derived to support authenticated self-contained objects
as containers carrying certification requests.</t>

<t>At least the following properties are required:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>proof-of-possession: demonstrates access to the private
key corresponding to the public key contained in a certification request.
This is typically achieved by a self-signature using the corresponding private key.</t>
  <t>proof-of-identity: provides data origin authentication of
the certification request. This typically is achieved by a signature
using the IDevID secret of the pledge.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The rest of this section gives an incomplete list of solution examples,
based on existing technology described in IETF documents:</t>

</section>
<section anchor="solution-options-for-proof-of-possession"><name>Solution Options for Proof-of-possession</name>

<t>Certification request objects: Certification requests are
  data structures protecting only the integrity of the contained data
  and providing proof-of-possession for a (locally generated) private key.
  Examples for certification request data structures are:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>PKCS#10 <xref target="RFC2986"/>. This certification request structure is self-signed to
protect its integrity and prove possession of the private key
that corresponds to the public key included in the request.</t>
  <t>CRMF <xref target="RFC4211"/>. Also this certificate request message format supports
integrity protection and proof-of-possession,
typically by a self-signature generated over (part of) the structure
with the private key corresponding to the included public key.
CRMF also supports further proof-of-possession methods
for types of keys that do not support any signature algorithm.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The integrity protection of certification request fields includes the public
  key because it is part of the data signed by the corresponding private key.
  Yet note that for the above examples this is not sufficient to provide data
  origin authentication, i.e., proof-of-identity. This extra property can be
  achieved by an additional binding to the IDevID of the pledge.
  This binding to source authentication supports the
  authorization decision for the certification request. The binding of data
  origin authentication to the certification request may be
  delegated to the protocol used for certificate management.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="solution-options-for-proof-of-identity"><name>Solution Options for Proof-of-identity</name>

<t>The certification request should be bound to
  an existing authenticated credential (here, the IDevID certificate) to enable a proof
  of identity and, based on it, an authorization of the certification request.
  The binding may be achieved through security options in an
  underlying transport protocol such as TLS if the authorization of the
  certification request is (completely) done at the next communication hop.
  This binding can also be done in a transport-independent way by wrapping the
  certification request with signature employing an existing IDevID.
  the BRSKI context, this will be the IDevID.
  This requirement is addressed by existing enrollment protocols
  in various ways, such as:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>EST <xref target="RFC7030"/> utilizes PKCS#10 to
encode the certification request. The Certificate Signing
Request (CSR) optionally provides a binding to the underlying TLS session
by including the tls-unique value in the self-signed PKCS#10 structure.
The tls-unique value results from the TLS handshake.
Since the TLS handshake includes client
authentication and the pledge utilizes its IDevID for it,
the proof-of-identity is provided by such a binding to the TLS session.
This can be supported using the EST /simpleenroll endpoint.
Note that the binding of the TLS handshake to the CSR is optional in EST.
As an alternative to binding to the underlying
TLS authentication in the transport layer, <xref target="RFC7030"/> sketches wrapping the CSR
with a Full PKI Request message using an existing certificate.</t>
  <t>SCEP <xref target="RFC8894"/> supports using a shared secret (passphrase) or
an existing certificate to protect CSRs based on
SCEP Secure Message Objects using CMS wrapping
(<xref target="RFC5652"/>). Note that the wrapping using
an existing IDevID in SCEP is referred to as renewal.
Thus SCEP does not rely on the security of the underlying transfer.</t>
  <t>CMP <xref target="RFC4210"/> supports using a shared secret (passphrase) or an existing
certificate, which may be an IDevID credential, to authenticate
certification requests via the PKIProtection structure in a PKIMessage.
The certification request is typically encoded utilizing CRMF,
while PKCS#10 is supported as an alternative.
Thus CMP does not rely on the security of the underlying transfer protocol.</t>
  <t>CMC <xref target="RFC5272"/> also supports utilizing a shared secret (passphrase) or
an existing certificate to protect certification requests,
which can be either in CRMF or PKCS#10 structure.
The proof-of-identity can be provided as part of a FullCMCRequest,
based on CMS <xref target="RFC5652"/> and signed with an existing IDevID secret.
Thus CMC does not rely on the security of the underlying transfer protocol.</t>
</list></t>

<!--
Note that, besides the existing enrollment protocols, there is
ongoing work in the ACE WG to define an encapsulation of EST messages in
OSCORE, which will result in a TLS-independent way of protecting EST.
This approach {{I-D.selander-ace-coap-est-oscore}}
may be considered as a further variant.

<section anchor="uc1"><name>Adaptations to BRSKI</name>

<t>In order to support alternative enrollment protocols, asynchronous enrollment,
and more general system architectures,
BRSKI-AE lifts some restrictions of BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
This way, authenticated self-contained objects such as those described in
<xref target="req-sol"/> above can be used for certificate enrollment.</t>

<t>The enhancements needed are kept to a minimum in order to ensure reuse of
already defined architecture elements and interactions.
In general, the communication follows the BRSKI model and utilizes the existing
BRSKI architecture elements.
In particular, the pledge initiates communication with the domain registrar
and interacts with the MASA as usual.</t>

<section anchor="architecture"><name>Architecture</name>

<t>The key element of BRSKI-AE is that the authorization of a certification request
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be performed based on an authenticated self-contained object.
The certification request is bound in a self-contained way
to a proof-of-origin based on the IDevID.
Consequently, the authentication and authorization of the certification request
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be done by the domain registrar and/or by other domain components. These components
may be offline or reside in some central backend of the domain operator (off-site)
as described in <xref target="sup-env"/>. The registrar and other on-site domain components
may have no or only temporary (intermittent) connectivity to them.
The certification request <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also be piggybacked on another protocol.</t>

<t>This leads to generalizations in the
placement and enhancements of the logical elements as shown in <xref target="uc1figure"/>.</t>

the domain registrar has mostly the same functionality as in BRSKI, namely
to facilitate the communication of the pledge with the MASA and the PKI.

<t>The following list provides an abstract description of the flow
depicted in <xref target="enrollfigure"/>.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>CA Certs Request: The pledge optionally requests the latest relevant
CA certificates. This ensures that the pledge has the
complete set of current CA certificates beyond the
pinned-domain-cert (which is contained in the voucher
and may be just the domain registrar certificate).</t>
  <t>CA Certs Response: It <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the current root CA certificate,
which typically is the LDevID trust anchor, and any additional certificates
that the pledge may need to validate certificates.</t>
  <t>Attribute Request: Typically, the automated bootstrapping occurs
without local administrative configuration of the pledge.
Nevertheless, there are cases in which the pledge may also
include additional attributes specific to the target domain
into the certification request. To get these attributes in
advance, the attribute request can be used.</t>
  <t>Attribute Response: It <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the attributes to be included
in the subsequent certification request.</t>
  <t>Certificate Request: This certification request <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the
authenticated self-contained object ensuring both proof-of-possession of the
corresponding private key and proof-of-identity of the requester.</t>
  <t>Certificate Response: The certification response message <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain on success
the requested certificate and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include further information,
like certificates of intermediate CAs.</t>
  <t>Certificate Confirm: An optional confirmation sent
after the requested certificate has been received and validated.
It contains a positive or negative confirmation by the pledge whether
the certificate was successfully enrolled and fits its needs.</t>
  <t>PKI/Registrar Confirm: An acknowledgment by the PKI or registrar
that <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be sent on reception of the Cert Confirm.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The generic messages described above may be implemented using various
enrollment protocols supporting authenticated self-contained objects,
as described in <xref target="req-sol"/>. Examples are available in <xref target="exist_prot"/>.</t>

<t><strong>Pledge - registrar - enrollment status telemetry</strong></t>

<t>The enrollment status telemetry is performed as specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
In BRSKI this is described as part of the enrollment phase,
but due to the generalization on the enrollment protocol described in this document
it fits better as a separate step here.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="addressing"><name>Enhancements to Addressing Scheme</name>

<t>BRSKI-AE provides generalizations to the addressing scheme defined in
BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/> to accommodate alternative enrollment protocols that
use authenticated self-contained objects for certification requests.
As this is supported by various existing enrollment protocols,
they can be directly employed (see also <xref target="exist_prot"/>).</t>

<t>The addressing scheme in BRSKI for certification requests and
the related CA certificates and CSR attributes retrieval functions
uses the definition from EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>; here on the
example of simple enrollment: "/.well-known/est/simpleenroll".
This approach is generalized to the following notation:
"/.well-known/&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;/&lt;request&gt;"
in which &lt;enrollment-protocol&gt; refers to a certificate enrollment protocol.
Note that enrollment is considered here a message sequence
that contains at least a certification request and a certification response.
The following conventions are used in order to provide maximal compatibility to BRSKI:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;: <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reference the protocol being used, which
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be CMP, CMC, SCEP, EST <xref target="RFC7030"/> as in BRSKI, or a newly defined approach.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Note: additional endpoints (well-known URIs) at the registrar
may need to be defined by the enrollment protocol being used.</t>
  <t>&lt;request&gt;: if present, the &lt;request&gt; path component <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> describe,
depending on the enrollment protocol being used, the operation requested.
Enrollment protocols are expected to define their request endpoints,
as done by existing protocols (see also <xref target="exist_prot"/>).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="discovery_eo"><name>Domain Registrar Support of Alternative Enrollment Protocols</name>

<t>Well-known URIs for various endpoints on the domain registrar are
already defined as part of the base BRSKI specification or indirectly by EST.
In addition, alternative enrollment endpoints <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be supported at the registrar.
The pledge will recognize whether its
preferred enrollment option is supported by the domain registrar
by sending a request to its preferred enrollment endpoint
and evaluating the HTTP response status code.</t>

<t>The following list of endpoints provides an illustrative example for
a domain registrar supporting several options for EST as well as for
CMP to be used in BRSKI-AE. The listing contains the supported
endpoints to which the pledge may connect for bootstrapping. This
includes the voucher handling as well as the enrollment endpoints.
The CMP related enrollment endpoints are defined as well-known URIs
in CMP Updates <xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-cmp-updates"/>
and the Lightweight CMP profile <xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile"/>.</t>

<section anchor="exist_prot"><name>Instantiation to Existing Enrollment Protocols</name>

<t>This section maps the requirements to support proof-of-possession and
proof-of-identity to selected existing enrollment protocols
handles provides further aspects of instantiating them in BRSKI-AE.</t>

<!--
Note that the work in the ACE WG described in
{{I-D.selander-ace-coap-est-oscore}} may be considered
here as well, as it also addresses the encapsulation of EST in a way to
make it independent of the underlying TLS connection using OSCORE,
which also entails that authenticated self-contained objects are used.
-->

<section anchor="brski-est-fullcmc-instantiation-to-est-informative"><name>BRSKI-EST-fullCMC: Instantiation to EST (informative)</name>

<t>When using EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>, the following aspects and constraints
need to be considered and the given extra requirements need to be fulfilled,
which adapt Section 5.9.3 of BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>proof-of-possession is provided typically by using the specified PKCS#10
structure in the request.
Together with Full PKI requests, also CRMF can be used.</t>
  <t>proof-of-identity needs to be achieved by signing the certification request
object using the Full PKI Request option (including the /fullcmc endpoint).
This provides sufficient information for the RA to authenticate the pledge
as the origin of the request and to make an authorization decision on the
received certification request.
Note: EST references CMC <xref target="RFC5272"/> for the
definition of the Full PKI Request. For proof-of-identity, the
signature of the SignedData of the Full PKI Request is
performed using the IDevID secret of the pledge.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Note: In this case the binding to the underlying TLS connection is not necessary.</t>
  <t>When the RA is temporarily not available, as per Section 4.2.3 of <xref target="RFC7030"/>,
an HTTP status code 202 should be returned by the registrar,
and the pledge will repeat the initial Full PKI Request</t>
</list></t>

this document refers to the Lightweight CMP Profile
<xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile"/> because
the subset of CMP defined there is sufficient for the functionality needed here.</t>

	 <t>   This document contains a set of updates to the syntax and transfer of
   Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) version 2.  This document
   updates RFC 4210, RFC 5912, and RFC 6712.

   The aspects of CMP updated in this document are using EnvelopedData
   instead of EncryptedValue, clarifying the handling of p10cr messages,
   improving the crypto agility, as well as adding new general message
   types, extended key usages to identify certificates for use with CMP,
   and &#39;.well-known&#39; HTTP path segments.

   To properly differentiate the support of EnvelopedData instead of
   EncryptedValue, the CMP version 3 is introduced in case a transaction
   is supposed to use EnvelopedData.

   CMP version 3 is introduced to enable signaling support of
   EnvelopedData instead of EncryptedValue and signaling the use of an
   explicit hash AlgorithmIdentifier in certConf messages, as far as
   needed.

	 <t>   This document aims at simple, interoperable, and automated PKI
   management operations covering typical use cases of industrial and
   IoT scenarios.  This is achieved by profiling the Certificate
   Management Protocol (CMP), the related Certificate Request Message

   but sufficiently detailed and self-contained way.  To make secure
   certificate management for simple scenarios and constrained devices
   as lightweight as possible, only the most crucial types of operations
   and options are specified as mandatory.  More special and complex use

<section anchor="using-est"><name>Using EST for Certificate Enrollment</name>

<t>When using EST with BRSKI, pledges interact via TLS with the domain registrar,
which acts both as EST server and as registration authority (RA).
The TLS connection is mutually authenticated,
where the pledge uses its IDevID certificate issued by its manufacturer.</t>

<t>In order to provide a strong proof-of-origin of the certification request,
EST has the option to include in the certification request
the so-called tls-unique value <xref target="RFC5929"/> of the underlying TLS channel.
This binding of the proof-of-identity of the TLS client, which is supposed to
be the certificate requester, to the proof-of-possession for the private key is
conceptually non-trivial and requires specific support by TLS implementations.</t>

<t>The registrar terminates the security association with the pledge at TLS level
and thus the binding between the certification request and the authentication
of the pledge.
The EST server uses the authenticated pledge identity provided by the IDevID
for checking the authorization of the pledge for the given certification request
before issuing to the pledge a domain-specific certificate (LDevID certificate).
This approach typically requires online or on-site availability of the RA
for performing the final authorization decision for the certification request.</t>

<t>Using EST for BRSKI has the advantage that the mutually authenticated TLS
connection established between the pledge and the registrar can be reused
for protecting the message exchange needed for enrolling the LDevID certificate.
This strongly simplifies the implementation of the enrollment message exchange.</t>

<t>Yet the use of TLS has the limitation that this cannot provide auditability
nor end-to-end security for the certificate enrollment request
because the TLS session is transient and terminates at the registrar.
This is a problem in particular if the enrollment is done via multiple hops,
part of which may not even be network-based.</t>

<t>A further limitation of using EST as the certificate enrollment protocol is that
due to using PKCS#10 structures in enrollment requests,
the only possible proof-of-possession method is a self-signature, which
excludes requesting certificates for key types that do not support signing.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="app-examples"><name>Application Examples</name>

<t>This informative annex provides some detail to
the application examples listed in <xref target="list-examples"/>.</t>

<section anchor="rolling-stock"><name>Rolling Stock</name>

<t>Rolling stock or railroad cars contain a variety of sensors,
actuators, and controllers, which communicate within the railroad car
but also exchange information between railroad cars building a train,
with track-side equipment, and/or possibly with backend systems.
These devices are typically unaware of backend system
connectivity. Managing certificates may be done during maintenance
cycles of the railroad car, but can already be prepared during
operation. Preparation will include generating certification requests,
which are collected and later forwarded for
processing, once the railroad car is connected to the operator backend.
The authorization of the certification request is then done based on
the operator's asset/inventory information in the backend.</t>

<t>UNISIG has included a CMP profile for enrollment of TLS certificates of
on-board and track-side components in the Subset-137 specifying the ETRAM/ETCS
on-line key management for train control systems <xref target="UNISIG-Subset-137"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="building-automation"><name>Building Automation</name>

<t>In building automation scenarios, a detached
building or the basement of a building may be equipped with sensors, actuators,
and controllers that are connected with each other in a local network but
with only limited or no connectivity to a central building management system.
This problem may occur during installation time but also during operation.
In such a situation a service technician collects the necessary data
and transfers it between the local network and the central building management
system, e.g., using a laptop or a mobile phone.
This data may comprise parameters and settings
required in the operational phase of the sensors/actuators, like a
component certificate issued by the operator to authenticate against other
components and services.</t>

<t>The collected data may be provided by a domain registrar
already existing in the local network. In this case
connectivity to the backend PKI may be facilitated by the service
technician's laptop.
Alternatively, the data can also be collected from the
pledges directly and provided to a domain registrar deployed in a
different network as preparation for the operational phase.
In this case, connectivity to the domain registrar
may also be facilitated by the service technician's laptop.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="substation-automation"><name>Substation Automation</name>

<t>In electrical substation automation scenarios, a control center typically hosts
PKI services to issue certificates for Intelligent Electronic Devices
(IEDs) operated in a substation. Communication between the substation
and control center is performed through a proxy/gateway/DMZ, which
terminates protocol flows. Note that <xref target="NERC-CIP-005-5"/> requires
inspection of protocols at the boundary of a security
perimeter (the substation in this case).
In addition, security management in substation automation assumes
central support of several enrollment protocols in order to support the
various capabilities of IEDs from different vendors. The IEC standard
IEC62351-9 <xref target="IEC-62351-9"/> specifies mandatory
support of two enrollment protocols: SCEP <xref target="RFC8894"/> and EST
<xref target="RFC7030"/> for the infrastructure side, while
the IED must only support one of the two.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure"><name>Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure</name>

<t>For electric vehicle charging infrastructure, protocols have been
defined for the interaction between the electric vehicle and the
charging point (e.g., ISO 15118-2 <xref target="ISO-IEC-15118-2"/>)
as well as between the charging point and the charging point operator
(e.g. OCPP <xref target="OCPP"/>). Depending on the authentication
model, unilateral or mutual authentication is required. In both cases
the charging point uses an X.509 certificate to authenticate itself
in TLS connections between the electric vehicle and
the charging point. The management of this certificate depends,
among others, on the selected backend connectivity protocol.
In the case of OCPP, this protocol is meant to be the only communication
protocol between the charging point and the backend, carrying all
information to control the charging operations and maintain the
charging point itself. This means that the certificate management
needs to be handled in-band of OCPP. This requires the ability to
encapsulate the certificate management messages in a transport-independent way.
Authenticated self-containment will support this by
allowing the transport without a separate enrollment protocol,
binding the messages to the identity of the communicating endpoints.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="infrastructure-isolation-policy"><name>Infrastructure Isolation Policy</name>

<t>This refers to any case in which network infrastructure is normally
isolated from the Internet as a matter of policy, most likely for
security reasons. In such a case, limited access to external PKI
services will be allowed in carefully controlled short periods of
time, for example when a batch of new devices is deployed, and
forbidden or prevented at other times.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sites-with-insufficient-level-of-operational-security"><name>Sites with Insufficient Level of Operational Security</name>

<t>The registration authority performing (at least part of) the authorization of a
certification request is a critical PKI component and therefore requires higher
operational security than components utilizing the issued
certificates for their security features. CAs may also demand higher
security in the registration procedures. Especially the CA/Browser
forum currently increases the security requirements in the certificate
issuance procedures for publicly trusted certificates.
In case the on-site components of the target domain cannot be operated securely
enough for the needs of a registration authority, this service should be
transferred to an off-site backend component that has a sufficient level of security.</t>
